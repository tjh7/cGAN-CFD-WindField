# cGAN-CFD-WindField
Code and dataset for “A New Data-Driven Model for Rapid Urban Low-Level Wind Field Simulation Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks”.
using:

High-resolution CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) simulation data at multiple heights

256×256 urban morphology images

Conditional inflow information

A custom-designed U-Net generator and PatchGAN discriminator

The framework significantly reduces CFD computational costs and enables fast prediction of near-surface wind fields under strong wind conditions.
